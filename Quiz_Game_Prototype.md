# ðŸŽ® Quiz Game App â€” Optimized Prompt & Prototype

## Optimized Prompt
Build a modern, addictive quiz game app for desktop (.exe) and mobile (Play Store/App Store). The app allows users to select a subject and topic, then answer multiple-choice questions (4 alternatives, 1 correct). The app must feature:

- **Admin Tools**: Admins can set questions manually or generate bulk questions using AI. Questions should have difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).
- **Gameplay Modes**: Play solo, with a friend, or against AI.
- **Immersive Experience**: Include sound effects, background music, and optional voice narration. Add smooth 3D animations, transitions, and gamified interactions.
- **Power-ups & Rewards**: Users earn credits, gems, points, and bonuses. These can be spent to slash two wrong answers, delay the timer, swap options, or unlock hints.
- **Tournaments & Challenges**: Admins set up tournaments with customizable entry fees, minimum subscribers, and rewards for top 3 players. Scheduled tournaments launch automatically when the date is due.
- **Addictive Game Design**: Leaderboards, streak bonuses, achievements, and daily login rewards.
- **Cross-platform**: Responsive for desktop and mobile, compiled as .exe for PC and as native builds for Play Store/App Store.
